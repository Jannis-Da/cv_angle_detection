# DouplePendulum_AngleDetection

### Description
This application can be used, to detect the angles of a double-pendulum with a computer vision approach. It is mostly based on the openCV-Library (4.6) and uses classic image processing algorithms to detect image features for computing the angles and the angular velocities.

The project is very specific to a particular hardware setup. By providing essential data, it forms the basis for a machine learning based control of the double pendulum using an electric motor which will be implemented in a later project.

### Requirements
The project is based almost entirely on python scripts, so logically the installation of Python is necessary. In addition, the libraries openCV, pandas, pyueye and numpy must be installed to be able to use all functionalities.

### How to use
In the script 'src/demo.py', sample applications are implemented for all functionalities and the use of the software is explained in more detail with inline comments.
